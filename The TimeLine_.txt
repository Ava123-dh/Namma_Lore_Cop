## Founding (322 BCE)
Chandragupta Maurya, guided by mentor Chanakya (Kautilya), overthrew the Nanda dynasty through guerrilla warfare and civil unrest, seizing Magadha's capital Pataliputra. This victory unified northern India, establishing centralized administration via the Arthashastra treatise on governance, economy, and espionage. Chandragupta's coalition expelled lingering Greek forces, laying foundations for imperial expansion across the subcontinent.[2][3]


## Seleucid Victory (305 BCE)
Chandragupta defeated Seleucus I Nicator's invading army, securing northwestern territories in a treaty that gained 500 elephants and diplomatic marriages. This halted Hellenistic incursions, extended Mauryan borders to modern Afghanistan, and boosted military prestige. The peace fostered Indo-Greek exchanges in culture and trade, enhancing the empire's wealth.[1][2]


## Kalinga Conquest (262 BCE)
Ashoka's brutal annexation of Kalinga killed over 100,000, with massive casualties among soldiers and civilians shocking the emperor. Witnessing the bloodshed led to his conversion to Buddhism, renouncing violence for dhamma (moral law). This pivot promoted non-violence, welfare policies, and missionary spread of Buddhism across Asia.[3][2]


## Edicts Issued (260 BCE)
Ashoka inscribed rock and pillar edicts promoting ethical governance, banning animal sacrifices, ensuring fair justice, and environmental protections. These multilingual proclamations, found empire-wide, standardized moral codes and abolished slavery in parts. They represent early welfare state ideals, influencing later Indian ethics and global human rights concepts.[7][2]


## Empire's Fall (185 BCE)
Weak later rulers like Brihadratha lost territories to revolts and invasions; Pushyamitra Shunga assassinated him during a parade, founding the Shunga dynasty. Internal decay from over-centralization, high taxes, and succession strife fragmented the realm. This ended Mauryan rule, ushering Hindu resurgence and regional kingdoms.[2][3]

The Kadamba Dynasty (c. 345–540 CE) was an early Kannada kingdom in Karnataka, founded by Mayurasharma, pioneering local rule post-Gupta era with influences on art, architecture, and Shaivism. Key events defined its rise, expansions, and vassalage under Chalukyas.[1][2]


## Founding (345 CE)
Mayurasharma, a Brahmin scholar from Talagunda, rebelled against Pallava overlord Skandavarman after a temple insult, defeating him with Ganga allies. He established Banavasi as capital, marking Karnataka's first native dynasty with Vedic rituals and land grants. This shift fostered indigenous Kannada identity and temple-building traditions.[3][1]


## Kakusthavarma's Peak (435 CE)
Kakusthavarma expanded territory via alliances and wars against Gangas, Vakatakas, and Pallavas, marrying into royal families for diplomacy. He shifted capital to Kolar temporarily, patronized Jainism, and boosted trade, controlling Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra parts. His court poet Durvinita chronicled these conquests, elevating Kadamba cultural prestige.[1][3]


## Ravivarma's Wars (485 CE)
Ravivarma clashed with Pallavas, Gangas, and internal Triparvata branch, extending north to Narmada River against Vakatakas. Ruling amid family feuds, he maintained core territories through military prowess and Shaiva temples like Banavasi's Madhukeshvara. His victories sustained dynasty but sowed decline seeds via infighting.[5][1]


## Chalukya Conquest (540 CE)
Badami Chalukyas under Pulakeshin I overthrew weakened Kadambas, reducing them to vassals after Ravivarma's successors faltered. This ended independent rule, fragmenting into branches in Goa, Halasi, and Hangal under larger empires. Kadamba legacy persisted in architecture and minor kingdoms for centuries.[2][1]

## Pulakesin I's Founding (543 CE)
Pulakesin I established Chalukya sovereignty by fortifying Badami (Vatapi) as capital and performing Ashvamedha yajna, asserting imperial status. He defeated local Kadambas, Nalas, and Mauryas, laying foundations for Deccan dominance. This marked the dynasty's emergence post-Gupta decline, blending martial prowess with Vaishnava devotion.[7][1]


## Narmada Victory (618 CE)
Pulakesin II halted Harshavardhana's southern expansion at the Narmada River, earning the title Satyashraya. This preserved Chalukya independence, boosted prestige, and fixed northern borders. The Aihole inscription celebrates it as a pivotal check on North Indian hegemony.[3][1]


## Kanchi Plunder (631 CE)
Vikramaditya I sacked Pallava capital Kanchipuram, avenging his father's defeat by Narasimhavarman I. He installed a victory pillar at Kailasanatha Temple with Kannada inscription. This reversed Pallava gains, affirming Chalukya supremacy in South India temporarily.[1][3]


## Eastern Branch Independence (624 CE)
Pulakesin II granted Vengi to brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana, founding Eastern Chalukyas stretching to Andhra coasts. This split fostered bilingual administration and alliances against common foes. It endured until 1070 CE, influencing Telugu culture and temple arts.[4][1]


## Vikramaditya II's Triumphs (740 CE)
Vikramaditya II overran Kanchipuram thrice, decisively crushing Pallavas and repelling Arab incursions in Gujarat. His victories ended Pallava power, promoted Vesara architecture like Virupaksha Temple. The reign epitomized Chalukya military zenith and cultural flourishing.[3][1]


## Rashtrakuta Overthrow (753 CE)
Dantidurga, a feudatory, defeated Kirtivarman II, ending Badami Chalukyas and founding Rashtrakutas. Internal weaknesses, prolonged wars, and overextension caused fragmentation. This shifted Deccan power, though Kalyani Chalukyas later revived the line.[2][7]

## Founding by Dantidurga (753 CE)
Dantidurga, a Chalukya feudatory, defeated Kirtivarman II, seizing Badami and performing Hiranya Garbha ritual to claim Kshatriya status. He fixed Manyakheta as capital, conquering Malwa, Kalinga, and Kosala. This ended Chalukya rule, establishing Rashtrakuta power across Maharashtra and beyond.[3][1]


## Krishna I's Conquests (756–774 CE)
Krishna I subdued Gangas, conquered Konkan, and accepted Eastern Chalukya submission without battle. His reign saw the Kailasa Temple's construction at Ellora, a monolithic marvel. Victories expanded territory to Godavari, blending military might with Shaivite devotion.[4][1]


## Dhruva Dharavarsha's Rise (780–793 CE)
Dhruva quelled brothers' rebellions, defeated Nagabhata II of Kannauj, and subjugated Malwa, Vengi, and Pallavas. He humbled Pratiharas and Palas in the tripartite struggle's onset. His campaigns marked Rashtrakuta entry into northern politics, peaking imperial prestige.[2][1]


## Govinda III's Peak (793–814 CE)
Govinda III crushed Pratiharas, annexed Malwa, Kosala, and Kalinga, then raided south to Rameshwaram, erecting a victory pillar. He fostered alliances via marriages and quelled Vengi revolts. This era epitomized territorial zenith from Narmada to Tamil lands.[1][4]


## Indra III's Kannauj Capture (916 CE)
Indra III sacked Kannauj from Pratiharas, advancing to Ganges-Yamuna doab and defeating Palas. He restored Rashtrakuta northern influence amid weak successors. Victories over Malwa and Vengi bolstered the dynasty temporarily.[5][1]


## Krishna III's Southern Push (939–967 CE)
Krishna III conquered Tondaimandalam, occupied Kanchi, and extracted Ceylon tribute, stretching rule to Kaveri. He built Jain temples and supported literature. Internal foes united post-death, sacking Manyakheta in 972 CE, hastening decline.[6][1]

The Western Chalukya revival, known as the Chalukyas of Kalyani (973–1189 CE), re-established Chalukya rule after Rashtrakuta dominance, with capitals at Manyakheta and Kalyani. Key events highlight their military resurgence, cultural patronage, and conflicts with Cholas, Hoysalas, and Kalachuris.[1][4]


## Tailapa II's Overthrow (973 CE)
Tailapa II, a Rashtrakuta feudatory, exploited their decline amid Paramara invasions to defeat Karka II, reclaiming Deccan territories. He restored Chalukya lineage from Badami Chalukyas, performed Vedic sacrifices, and patronized Kannada poet Ranna. This founding revived imperial ambitions, stabilizing rule for two centuries.[2][1]


## Chola Invasion Repelled (1006 CE)
Satyashraya faced Rajaraja Chola I's devastating raid on Kalyani but mounted counterattacks, preserving core lands. Though territories were lost temporarily, it checked Chola expansion northward. The conflict initiated prolonged Chalukya-Chola wars, shaping Deccan geopolitics.[3][1]


## Jayasimha II's Victories (1020s CE)
Jayasimha II recaptured Kollipara from Cholas, defeated Paramara Bhoja of Malwa, and allied with Chandelas against common foes. He shifted patronage to Shaivism, building temples like those at Itagi. His reign stabilized the empire, fostering Vesara architecture and Kannada literature.[4][1]


## Vikramaditya VI's Accession (1076 CE)
Vikramaditya VI seized the throne from brother Someshvara II, ushering a 50-year golden age with Chalukya-Vikrama era dating. He subdued rebels, raided Chola territories, and commissioned Vikramankadeva Charita chronicle. His court thrived with scholars like Bilhana and Vijnaneshvara, advancing legal texts like Mitakshara.[1][3]


## Someshvara IV's Resistance (1184 CE)
Someshvara IV fought Hoysala and Yadava incursions amid internal strife but lost Kalyani to Kalachuri Bijjala II's usurpation. Feudal revolts and overextension weakened defenses. This marked the dynasty's effective end, fragmenting into successor states.[3][1]

The Hoysala Kingdom (c. 1026–1343 CE), originating as Chalukya feudatories in Karnataka's Malnad hills, rose to prominence through military prowess and Vesara temple architecture. Key events trace its path from vassalage to Deccan power amid Chola, Kalachuri, and Pandyas conflicts.[1][2]


## Nripa Kama II's Founding (1026 CE)
Nripa Kama II, titled "Permanadi," established Hoysala rule by consolidating hill territories and allying with Western Gangas and Chalukyas. He built early temples like those at Belur, marking the dynasty's emergence as regional chieftains. This laid administrative foundations, blending Kannada culture with Vaishnava and Jaina patronage.[3][1]


## Vinayaditya's Expansion (1047 CE)
Vinayaditya solidified power by defeating Chalukya rivals and expanding into Karnataka plains, earning imperial titles. His 50-year reign fostered military reforms and land grants, boosting economy via agriculture. Belur became the nascent capital, symbolizing Hoysala ascent post-Chalukya turbulence.[2][4]


## Talakad Victory (1116 CE)
Vishnuvardhana crushed Chola forces at Talakad, annexing Gangavadi and renaming himself "Bitti Deva." Inspired by Ramanuja, he converted to Vaishnavism, commissioning Chennakesava Temple at Belur. This battle ended Chola dominance in Karnataka, elevating Hoysalas to major powers.[6][1]


## Ballala II's Independence (1193 CE)
Veera Ballala II declared sovereignty after defeating Yadavas and Kadambas, shifting capital to Dwarasamudra (Halebidu). He campaigned against Seunas and Pandyas, expanding to Tamil borders. His rule marked peak territorial control and Hoysala cultural zenith with ornate temples.[4][1]


## Hoysala-Pandya War (1318 CE)
Veera Ballala III allied with Kampili against Delhi Sultanate but faced Pandyas, sacking Madurai temporarily. Chronic wars drained resources amid four-way Deccan struggles. This highlighted Hoysala resilience yet foreshadowed fragmentation from invasions.[1][4]


## Final Fall (1343 CE)
Veera Ballala III died fighting Madurai Sultanate at Tiruvadi, ending Hoysala rule. Territories merged into Vijayanagara under Harihara I, a possible Hoysala commander. Legacy endured in architecture at Belur-Halebidu UNESCO sites and Kannada literature.[4][1]

The Vijayanagara Empire (1336–1646 CE), founded by Harihara I and Bukka Raya I amid Delhi Sultanate incursions, became South India's bulwark against Muslim expansions. Key events highlight its military zenith, cultural patronage, and cataclysmic fall.[1][2]


## Empire Founded (1336 CE)
Harihara I and Bukka Raya I, former Hoysala feudatories, established Vijayanagara on Tungabhadra's southern banks after escaping Tughlaq captivity and reconverting to Hinduism under sage Vidyaranya. They unified fragmented Hindu kingdoms, building Hampi as a fortified capital. This countered northern invasions, fostering Dravidian revival in arts and administration.[2][1]


## Bukka's Conquests (1370s CE)
Bukka Raya I expanded borders by defeating Madurai Sultanate, Kondavidu Reddis, and Arcot chiefs, controlling eastern seas to Goa. He promoted Shaivism, constructed temples, and centralized taxation for military strength. These victories secured trade routes, boosting economy through ports like Bhatkal.[7][8]


## Krishnadevaraya Crowned (1509 CE)
Krishnadevaraya ascended, launching campaigns that crushed Gajapati Odisha, Bijapur Adil Shahis, and Ummattur Nayaks, annexing Raichur Doab. His Amuktamalyada epic and Vitthala Temple patronage epitomized Telugu literature and Vijayanagara architecture. Reign marked empire's golden age in prosperity and military invincibility.[2][7]


## Battle of Raichur (1520 CE)
Krishnadevaraya decisively defeated Bijapur's Ismail Adil Shah at Raichur Doab, capturing strategic fortress despite artillery superiority. This preserved southern frontiers, yielded massive loot including diamonds, and reinforced Vijayanagara hegemony. Portuguese accounts praise his tactical genius with war elephants and infantry.[2]


## Talikota Defeat (1565 CE)
Alliance of Deccan Sultanates (Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, Golconda, Bidar) crushed Vijayanagara forces at Rakshasa-Tangadi (Talikota), killing Ramaraya. Hampi was sacked for months, temples desecrated, irrigation ruined. This shattered the empire, fragmenting it into Nayak principalities while ending centralized Hindu power.[1][7]

The Keladi Nayaka Kingdom (1499–1763 CE), a Vijayanagara feudatory that gained independence post-1565, ruled Karnataka's Malnad and coastal regions with Virashaiva patronage, forts, and trade. Key events trace its founding, expansions, and fall.[1][5]


## Founding by Chaudappa (1499 CE)
Chaudappa Nayaka (Chauda Gowda), from Pallibailu near Keladi, rose from farmer to Vijayanagara vassal, establishing rule over Shimoga-area territories. He fortified Keladi as capital, blending agriculture with military control amid imperial decline. This laid foundations for a dynasty blending Vokkaliga roots and Veerashaiva faith.[2][1]


## Sadashiva's Consolidation (1530 CE)
Sadashiva Nayaka expanded domains, defeating local chieftains and securing Malnad hills. He shifted capital briefly for defense, fostering rice-pepper trade routes. His reign solidified autonomy, building temples like Rameshwara and promoting Kannada literature.[5][1]


## Venkatappa I's Independence (1586 CE)
Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka broke Vijayanagara overlordship post-Talikota, conquering coastal Kanara to Tungabhadra plains. He defeated Gerusoppa's Bhairadevi, curbed Portuguese advances, and erected Hangal victory pillar. Multi-faith temple constructions marked cultural zenith.[2][5]


## Shivappa Nayaka's Reforms (1629 CE)
Shivappa expanded to Mysore borders, codifying land revenue (Ashta Bhaga system) for efficient taxation. He built forts like Bhuvanagiri, suppressed rebellions, and patronized arts despite wars. His administrative innovations sustained prosperity amid Bijapur threats.[6][1]


## Chennamma's Regency (1672 CE)
Queen Chennamaji I defended against Bijapur invasions, allying with Marathas for survival. She constructed Ikkeri palace complexes and promoted trade with Europeans. Her diplomacy preserved the kingdom during Mughal pressures.[1][5]


## Hyder Ali Conquest (1763 CE)
Hyder Ali of Mysore overran Keladi, dethroning Queen Virammaji after draining wars with Marathas and locals. Treasury exhaustion and succession disputes ended the dynasty. Territories integrated into Mysore, closing a 264-year era of regional power.[5][2]

Hyder Ali (c. 1720–1782) rose from a cavalry soldier to de facto ruler of Mysore by 1761, modernizing its army and challenging British expansion through strategic brilliance. Key events trace his ascent amid Wodeyar decline and regional chaos.[1][5]


## Early Military Rise (1740s)
Hyder Ali joined Mysore's army as a foot soldier, quickly advancing to cavalry command through valor in campaigns against Marathas and locals. His tactical acumen impressed Nanjaraja, leading to oversight of artillery and infantry by the 1750s. This foundation showcased his adoption of European drill and rockets, transforming ragtag forces into disciplined units.[3][5]


## Srirangapatna Control (1757)
Summoned to defend Srirangapatna from Hyderabad and Maratha threats, Hyder quelled army mutiny over unpaid wages and repelled invaders. He extracted concessions from Devaraja, gaining military command and fort repairs. This victory solidified his influence over Mysore's strategic heartland.[4][5]


## Khande Rao Defeat (1760)
When minister Khande Rao plotted usurpation and fled with treasury, Hyder pursued, shattered his leaderless army near Srirangapatam, and seized guns, infantry, and baggage. He imprisoned Rao, appointed loyalists, and assumed full military control. This coup dismantled internal rivals, paving his path to supremacy.[5][4]


## De Facto Rule (1761)
Hyder sidelined weak Wodeyar king Krishnaraja II, becoming Sarvadhikari (chief minister) while retaining the throne nominally. He centralized revenue, reformed administration blending Hindu-Islamic systems, and styled himself Sultan in Mughal correspondence. Mysore emerged as a unified power resisting colonial inroads.[2][1]


## First Anglo-Mysore War (1767–1769)
Hyder repelled British invasion from Madras, capturing Trichinopoly and forcing treaty at Madras. Employing rocket artillery and guerrilla tactics, he humbled EIC forces despite alliances crumbling. Victory enhanced prestige, expanded borders, and deterred further northern aggression temporarily.[7][2]

Tipu Sultan's reign (1782–1799) as ruler of Mysore featured fierce resistance against British expansion through innovative warfare, including rocket artillery, amid the Anglo-Mysore Wars. His rule emphasized reforms but ended in defeat, reshaping South Indian power dynamics.[1][3]


## First Anglo-Mysore War End (1784)
Tipu inherited the war from his father Hyder Ali and signed the Treaty of Mangalore after mixed victories, restoring pre-war borders with the British East India Company. This fragile peace allowed military reorganization and rocket technology refinement. Despite setbacks like the loss at Port Novo, it preserved Mysore's autonomy temporarily.[3][1]


## Maratha Conflicts Peak (1787)
Tipu clashed with Marathas over border territories, winning sieges at Nargund and Adoni but losing Gajendragad, leading to the Treaty of Gajendragad. He ceded Badami, paid tribute, and returned captured lands, easing northern pressures. This diplomacy freed resources for British threats while fostering internal stability.[4][1]


## Travancore Invasion (1789)
Tipu attacked British ally Travancore, seizing the Nedumkotta line and prompting the Third Anglo-Mysore War declaration. His forces used iron-cased rockets effectively, but supply issues arose. The bold move aimed to preempt alliances but escalated British intervention across South India.[2][3]


## Treaty of Seringapatam (1792)
After defeats by Cornwallis, Tipu ceded half his territory, paid massive indemnity, and sent sons as hostages in this Third War treaty. It halved Mysore but retained core lands and spurred administrative reforms like new coinage. Rockets and scorched-earth tactics delayed invaders, buying time.[2][3]


## Rocket Innovations (1790s)
Tipu pioneered Mysorean rockets with iron casings reaching 2 km, used devastatingly at Pollilur (1780 legacy) and later battles, inspiring Congreve designs. He authored Fathul Mujahidin on tactics and expanded arsenals. This technological edge terrorized British forces, symbolizing indigenous innovation against colonialism.[6][1]


## Srirangapatna Fall (1799)
In the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, British-Nizam-Maratha coalition besieged the capital; Tipu died fighting on May 4. Mysore partitioned, Wodeyars restored under subsidiary alliance. His defiance marked the end of major Indian resistance, with rockets expended in final defense.[1][2]
